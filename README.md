## About
Hey you guys I am learning Rails and this is my sandbox. It's going to be a Learning Management System.

## Up and Running

#### Installation
```
bundle install
```

#### Start the Server
```
bundle exec rails s
```
The server should be available on `localhost:3000`

#### Login
Out of the box, in the dev environment, a working user with the email `pterodact@example.com` and password `pterodact` is available for use. Edit [seeds.rb](https://github.com/jmodjeska/pterodact/blob/master/db/seeds.rb#L30) to customize.
